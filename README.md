# Android Repo
This is the main repository of the android application of TrackCovidCluster.

# Purpose and Goals
To secure that your identity and privacy are protected at all times. The app does not record a location, but only recognizes the distance to other users and anonymously registers the contact.
If one of the users is infected, each contact person from the last two weeks will be notified. Without personal data and references.

# Backend/ Server Repository
